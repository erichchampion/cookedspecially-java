BUSINESS PLAN

1.	DESCRIPTION

	A client/server framework to provide tablet based menu browsing and ordering system for restaurants
	*** MORE STUFF NEDDED HERE ***

2.	CLIENT APPLICATION

	This section describes the client funcionality, workflow and user experience for both the customer 
	and the restaurant's staff

2.1 Application startup (STAFF)
	
	When the application launches it makes a call to the server to get the active restaurant's menus.
	NOTE: For now, we have hard-coded Axis restaurant ID, but in the future we should ask for the 
	restaurant's code and password in order to get the manus for a particular restaurant. 

	The application should check the server periodically (TBD) to check for menu updates and changes.
	
	Once the application gets the menu information it displays the Welcome screen. At this point the 
	manus can be browsed, but no orders can be created until a tableId/tabId has been selected by a 	
	member of restaurant's stuff (hosts, waiter, manager)

	Proposed API: getRestaurantMenus()
	
2.2	Table setup (STAFF)
		
	Each tablet device can handle mutiple tables' orders concurrently. The active tableId is set from
	the application's "Control Panel". The "Control Panel" canb be accessed only from the application's
	Welcome screen by clicking of the gear icon on the top right corner. 
	
	After entering a valid access code, the "Control Panel" becomes visible. The active table can 
	be set by:
	- Touching the active table name, or on "Select..." when there are no active tables
	- A list of the restaurant's tables, table capacity and status will be displayed. 
	- Select the desired table from the list
	
	When a table is set, the application makes a call to the server to get the current status of the
	table. The server should return a blank tabId/checkId if the table has no active tabs/check
	of the tabId with all the existing orders ad their status.
	
	Proposed API: getTableTab() or getTableCheck() or getTableStatus()

<pre>----------------------------------    
1.  DESCRIPTION

    A client/server framework that provides a tablet based menu browsing and ordering system for restaurants.
    The framework includes a tablet (client) application for iOS and Android and the back end infrastructure.
    
    *** MORE INFO NEDDED HERE ***

    
----------------------------------    
2.  CLIENT APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

    This section describes the client funcionality, workflow, and user experience for both the customer 
    and the restaurant's staff

2.1 Application startup (STAFF)
    
    When the application launches it makes a call to the server to get the active restaurant's menus.
    NOTE: For now, we have hard-coded Axis restaurant ID, but in the future we should ask for the 
    restaurant's code and password in order to get the menus for any particular restaurant. 

    The application should check the server periodically (TBD) to check for menu updates and changes.
    
    Once the application gets the menu information it displays the Welcome screen. At this point the 
    manus can be browsed, but no orders can be created until a tableId/tabId has been selected by a     
    member of restaurant's staff (hosts, waiter, manager)

    Proposed API: getRestaurantMenus()
    
    Open to discussion:
     - (?)
    
2.2 Table setup (STAFF)
        
    Each tablet device can handle orders for mutiple tables concurrently. The active tableId is set from
    the application's "Control Panel". The "Control Panel" can be accessed only from the application's
    Welcome screen by clicking of the gear icon on the top right corner. 
    
    After entering a valid access code, the "Control Panel" becomes visible and the active table can 
    be set or changed by:
     - Touching the active table name, or "Select..." when there are no active tables.
     - A list of the restaurant's tables, table capacity and status will be displayed. 
     - Select the desired table from the list
    
    When a table is set, the application makes a call to the server to get the table's current status.
    The server should return a blank tabId/checkId if the table has no active tabs/check of the tabId 
    with all the existing orders ad their status.
    
    The application uses the order information to display back to the customer the items that have 
    already been placed, their current status, and the current total amount.
    
    Proposed API: getTableTab() or getTableCheck() or getTableStatus()
    
    Open to discussion: 
     - status values: new, pending, in progress 
     - terminology: tabId vs. checkId vs. nothing
     - (?)

2.3 Add Items to Order (CUSTOMER)    
    
    Terminology
    Active Order:  Items that have been submitted to the server (cannot be changed by the customer)
    Pending Order: Items added to the application's local order and have not been submiter to the server.
                   
    The customer can add or remove items to the "pending order" until it is submitted (placed). After the
    "Pending Order: is submited, all the items will be moved to the "Active Order" 
    
    
2.4 View Tab/Check (CUSTOMER) 

    At any the customer can wiew the table's "Active Order" items and total amount. This is the equivalent 
    to asking for the check.
	
    Open to discussion: 
     - terminology: Tab vs. Check

     
----------------------------------    
4.  HANDLING ORDERS TO BAR/KITCHEN

    TBD (Erich / Akshay)

    
----------------------------------    
5.  HANDING PAYMENTS
    
    TBD (Erich / Akshay)

    
----------------------------------    
6.  REPORTING    

    Background:	At any time during the day and at the end of each shift, the waiters and the restaurant 
    managers must have access to the total amounts of tables and amounts to submit their money.
